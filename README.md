# Wilfrid Laurier Unviersity's Unofficial Course Information API

## Problem

Wilfrid Laurier University does not have a public api that developers could use to access information on course's available at the university.  
See current and only way of viewing course offerings via the [Academic Calendar](https://academic-calendar.wlu.ca/index_old.php?cal=1&y=85).  

## Purpose

The purpose of this API is to provide a way for developers to work with course information on Wilfrid Laurier University.  

## How I solved the Problem

I firstly have a bot scrape the [Academic Calendar](https://academic-calendar.wlu.ca/) for Wilfrid Laurier University and store the information into a csv file.  

I then run a python script that uses regex to parse through the csv file to format the pre-requisites for every course.  

After running the script I upload the data onto a mongodb database where it can be used by the microservice.  

After completing the development of the API I created a Dockerfile to build a Docker image of the application so that it could be deployed on Heroku as a container.  

## Use Cases

### Data Validation

[Simply-Degree](https://simplydegree.web.app/login)  
[SimplyDegree Repo](https://github.com/saifaldin14/SimplyDegree)  
Simply Degree is a complete visual degree management system for students to plan their courses, establish clear study routines and effectively take control of their semesters.  
It uses a modified version of the Wilfrid Laurier University Course Information API to validate that courses exist.  

## Future Improvements

1.  Develop a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab to automate the process of running tests on the application and building the Dockerfile so that it can be ready for deployment.  

2. Turn the API serverless by using AWS Lambda or an adjacent technology.  

3. Automate the process of running the web scraping bot that scrapes the Academic Calendar for course information.  

4. Automate the process of running the python script everytime new data is pulled from web scraping the Academic Calendar.  

5. Automate the process of uploading the formatted data onto MongoDB.  

## Technologies Used

ETL: Beautiful Soup, Python.  
Rest API: Node.js, Express.js.  
Database: MongoDB.  
Containerization: Docker.  
Cloud: Heroku.
